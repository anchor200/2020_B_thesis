    abstract = { Two measures were used to investigate the socioemotional effects of collaborative philosophical enquiry on children aged 11 at pre–test in five experimental and three control primary (elementary) school mainstream classes. Experimental teachers received initial and follow-up professional development. In a pre–post controlled design, experimental pupils used collaborative enquiry for one hour each week over a seven-month inter-test period. Control pupils followed a normal curriculum. On a test of self-esteem as a learner, experimental pupils (n = 119) gained significantly while controls (n = 52) did not. There was evidence of significant reduction in dependency and anxiety and of greater self-confidence. Girls tended to gain more than boys. These results were fairly consistent across schools/classes. On a scale for teacher observation of pupil social skills in problematic situations, a random sample of experimental pupils (n = 25) gained no more than controls (n = 22) overall. However, these results showed considerable variation across schools/classes. Implications for future research, practice and policy are addressed. }

abstract = {Background. Debates about the modifiability of cognitive ability have been largely resolved by reports of successful ‘thinking skills’ interventions. However, such interventions are very diverse and generalization of effects relatively little explored. Aims. This study investigated whether a thinking skills intervention involving collaborative interactive dialogue could lead not only to gains in measured verbal cognitive ability but also generalization to non-verbal and quantitative reasoning ability. Sample. Randomly selected intervention children were aged 10 at pre-test (N = 105, four classes/schools). Controls followed a normal curriculum (N = 72, three classes/two schools). Method. Intervention children engaged in collaborative enquiry for 1 hour per week over 16 months. The control group received normal classroom experiences. The Cognitive Abilities Test was administered before and after the intervention. Results. Intervention pupils showed significant standardized gains in verbal and also in non-verbal and quantitative aspects of reasoning, consistent across intervention schools. Boys and girls made significant gains. The highest quartile of pre-test ability showed the smallest gains. Controls did not gain in any aspect. Conclusions. Philosophical enquiry involving interactive dialogue led not only to significant gains in measured verbal cognitive ability but also generalization to non-verbal and quantitative reasoning ability, consistent across schools and largely irrespective of pupil gender and ability. The effect sizes from this large-scale field trial in one local authority exceeded those reported in the literature. Implications for theory building, replicability and sustainability are addressed.},

abstract = {Abstract Although conflict has traditionally been considered destructive, especially in collectivist societies like China, recent studies indicate that valuing and approaching conflict can contribute to effective teamwork. A hundred and six pairs of employees and their leaders were recruited from State Owned Enterprises in Shanghai and Nanjing. Employees described their conflict values and relationships. Their immediate supervisors rated the effectiveness of their teams and the extent of their citizenship behavior. Results indicate that positive conflict attitudes and approaching conflict can contribute to strong relationships, which in turn strengthen team effectiveness and employee citizenship. Findings suggest that how conflict values affect relationships and outcomes are more differentiated than originally expected. Results were interpreted as supporting the traditional idea that relationships are critical for effective organization work in China but also challenging future research to understand the processes by which conflict has a positive contribution to work relationships.

 abstract = {This study examines the structure of 105 work groups and management teams to address the question of whether conflict can be beneficial. Multiple methods were used to examine the effects of conflict on both individual- and group-level variables to provide a more refined model of intragroup conflict. Results show that whether conflict was beneficial depended on the type of conflict and the structure of the group in terms of task type, task interdependence, and group norms. Relationship and task conflicts were negatively associated with individuals' satisfaction, liking of other group members, and intent to remain in the group. In groups performing very routine tasks, disagreements about the task were detrimental to group functioning. In contrast, in groups performing nonroutine tasks, disagreements about the tasks did not have a detrimental effect, and in some cases, such disagreements were actually beneficial. Contrary to expectations, norms encouraging open discussion of conflict were not always advantageous. The results suggest that while such norms were associated with an increase in the number and intensity of relationship conflicts, they did not increase members' ability to deal with the conflicts constructively. The model developed here contributes to an integrated perspective on organizational conflict.},
